Since 2012, I've been working as a Software Engineer at [DataStax](https://www.datastax.com/). 
I've contributed many features, enhancements and bug-fixes to DataStax Enterprise, a highly scalable distributed database 
system based on [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/). 

I enjoy working on opensource for fun. I'm the initial author of [Spark Cassandra Connector](https://github.com/datastax/spark-cassandra-connector).
Recently I've been busy learning Rust by developing a [Fast Duplicate File Finder](https://github.com/pkolaczk/fclones).

I hold a PhD degree in computer science from Warsaw University of Technology and I worked at academia for some time in the past but eventually 
got bored writing research papers and I left. I'm still learning and exploring various areas of computer science and software engineering though, 
and I'll try to share what I've learned in this blog. 

I live in Warsaw, Poland, with my wife, two daughters and two sons.
